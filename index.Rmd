# Overview

## About the project

The objective of the Immune Mechanisms of Protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (IMPAc-TB) program is to
improve understanding of the immune responses necessary to avoid initial infection with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)*, formation of latent infection, and progression to active TB illness. To achieve these goals, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded substantial funding and established multidisciplinary research teams that will analyze immune responses against *Mtb* in animal models (mice, guinea pigs, and non-human primates) and humans, as well as immune responses elicited by promising vaccine candidates. 

This online book provides data collection templates and pre-processing protocols
for data types collected at the CSU branch of the Phoenix IMPAc-TB program. 
By using
standard templates to record data, as well as starting from defined pipelines to 
process and analyze the data, we aim to standardize the collection and processing
of data across this project.
