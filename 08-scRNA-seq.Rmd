### Overview

Single-cell RNA-seq belongs to an area of assays called transcriptomics, 
which aim to measure the presence and level of messenger RNA from different
genes in a sample. These types of assays help in understanding biological 
processes because they capture a snapshot of gene expression. Genes within 
a cell, when expressed, will create new protein products through a process
of transcription and translation, with messenger RNA serving to transfer the
genetic instructions for the protein product from the DNA to where it can 
be made into the associated protein. The level of mRNA from a gene isn't 
a perfect measure of how much of its associated protein is available in the 
cell, as proteins can degrade and be secreted at different rates, all of 
which contribute to the amount of protein present within the cell. However, 
it can help it identifying the proteins that the cell is in the process of 
making at the moment of sample collection, which is both correlated to 
some degree with protein composition in the cell and also is indicative of
actions the cell might be taking in response to stimuli and environmental 
conditions. 

> "Single-cell transcriptomics relies on the reverse transcription of RNA to
complementary DNA and subsequent amplification by PCR or in vitro transcription
before deep sequencingâ€”procedures prone to losses or biases. The biases are
exaggerated by the need for very high amplification from the small amounts of
RNA found in an individual cell. Although technical noise confounds precise
measurements of low-abundance transcripts, modern protocols have progressed to
the point that single-cell measurements are rich in biological information."

Until recently, transcriptomics assays primarily were conducted at a
bulk resolution, capturing the gene expression levels on average across the 
cells in the sample. Recently, methods have been developed to capture 
gene expression for each cell in the sample, an assay called single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). This assay provides an estimate of the expression
of each of a set of genes (often a very large set) for each cell in the 
original sample. Thus, like flow cytometry, it provides insights at the 
level of each cell, and as a result, the data collected will include many 
of [thousands?] of observations, rather than a single observation per 
sample.

> "Our notion of transcriptomes has been forged mainly by population-level
observations that have been the mainstream in biology over the last two decades.
We are used to thinking about differences in expression in terms of graded or
subtle fold changes when comparing data across entire tissues or conditions. But
the actual differences between cells may be far larger. Subsets of cells may
experience dramatic changes that are averaged out or diluted by the presence of
a large number of nonresponsive cells. In fact, it was shown over 60 years ago
that inductive cues often result in all-or-none responses in single cells but
these responses are observed as a gradual increase when quantified across the
population1. It is clear that assessing gene expression in single cells is
critical to better understand cellular behaviors and compositions in developing,
adult and pathological tissues. To this end, a long-standing goal has been to
enable genome-wide RNA profiling, or transcriptomics, in single cells2,3. Only
recently has the technology matured so that biologically meaningful differences
can be robustly detected with single-cell RNA-seq. ... Widespread adoption of
these techniques will have a major impact on our understanding and appreciation
of cellular states, the nature of transcription and gene regulation, and our
ability to characterize pathological states in disease." [@sandberg2014entering]

This information is helpful in identifying molecular processes at work in the
cells in the sample. Further, it can be used to classify each cell in the 
sample by cell type. To understand how, it's helpful to think about how 
the different types of cells in a multicellular organism differ. Every cell
in an organism has the same genetic code, outside the potential for a few
random variations in DNA from mutations to that cell or its ancestors
(e.g., mutation to a cell from exposure to radiation). What makes cells 
different types---some nerve cells, some muscle cells, some lung tissue
cells, some immune cells, and so on---is not their genetics, but how the
genes in that genetic code are expressed. Some genes will be regularly 
expressed in cells of one type but turned off in cells of another type, 
while other genes might express across multiple cell types, but at different
levels. A few genes are expressed in common across all types of cells 
(for example, housekeeping genes, which help ...), but there is enough 
variation in gene expression across cell types that a profile of this 
gene expression can be used to group cells in a sample into different 
types of cells. 

> "For example, a recurrent theme in single-cell transcriptome studies is that
cells reliably group by their cell type or state when subjected to unsupervised
clustering7,8,9,10. Gene expression associated with cell identity or
developmental stages thus has a stronger signal than technical noise or
biological variability related to dynamic processes such as phase of the cell
cycle. Moreover, the power to detect meaningful biological differences from
single-cell data is demonstrated by the identification of hundreds to thousands
of genes with differences in abundances between cell types7,9."
[@sandberg2014entering]

> "The measurement of gene expression in single cells will revolutionize our
understanding of gene regulation and resolve many longstanding debates in
biology. Cells cluster by cell type or developmental state when grouped
according to their expression profiles7,8,9,10. Thus, expression-based
clustering allows for the unbiased reconstruction or 'reverse engineering' of
cell types in any population or tissue after sequencing enough individual cells
(Fig. 1). If the sampling of cells is extensive and sufficiently free from
biases, such clustering can reveal all cell types present, including new ones.
All cells in a cluster can also be used to derive robust cell-type expression
profiles, again in a data-driven manner and without previous knowledge of which
marker genes define a tissue or cell type. Single-cell profiling of RNAs is
therefore the first method that could lay a foundation for a quantitative,
data-driven classification of cell types." [@sandberg2014entering]

This is one key thing that can be done using scRNA-seq. There are other 
methods that can identify and count cells of different types, providing 
a profile of the composition of cells in a sample. For example, flow 
cytometry is often used to characterize immune cell composition in a 
sample. However, to do so, flow cytometry tags and measures certain 
proteins on each cell's surface or interior, and rather than measuring 
every protein, this is limited to a set of proteins specified in a 
predefined panel of proteins. This panel is limited in the number of
proteins it can include, because only so many different fluourescent
tags can be independently distinguished. With scRNA-seq, you can measure
the expression levels of orders of magnitude [maybe one order?] more
proteins. This means that you may be able to identify clusters of cells
of the same type that are discovered *de novo* in that experiment, in 
addition to cell populations that were anticipated in the sample.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The gene expression within single cells is now studied through a process of
single cell RNA-seq, which leverages biological process, like use of the enzyme?
reverse transcriptase and PCR?, as well as complex computer algorithms to [put
things back together?].

Single cell RNA-seq aims to characterize the messenger RNA levels within 
each cell of a sample, as this provides a measure of the expression of 
specific genes within the cell---when a gene is expressed, its 
information is copied into messenger RNA, which carries the information 
to [other parts of the cell] where it can be used to create the protein
associated with that gene. Different types of cells will express different
genes, and cells will express different genes under different conditions, 
so information about gene expression can be used both to classify cells
by cell type and to characterize the activity of cells under different 
conditions. [Information on transcripts rather than genes?]

To measure levels of messenger RNA within each cell of a sample, sc-RNA-seq
leverages a fairly involved set of steps that leverage advanced biological and
computational ideas. First, the cells in the sample are lysed (essentially,
broken open) to access their contents. The content of messenger RNA in any
specific cell is small [@brennecke2013accounting], and so a process is conducted
to amplify that content so it can be measured. This involves first transcribing
the information in each messenger RNA to cDNA [complementary DNA?], which can
then be amplified using [PCR] [@haque2017practical]. The transcription uses the
enzyme reverse transcriptase [@haque2017practical], which [clever leveraging of
an existing biological process...]. In the course of this transcriptions, unique
molecular identifiers (UMIs) can be added to the transcription primers to
identify each initial mRNA molecule and the cell from which the mRNA came [?]
[@haque2017practical]. PCR leverages ... [also using biological processes]. Once
the cDNA are amplified, the information encoded in them can be extracted using
next-generation sequencing [@haque2017practical] and analysis of the resulting
raw sequencing data, which leverages [advanced algorithms?].

### Data format description

### Processing collected data

### Details of processing script

1. Process the raw sequencing data and "demultiplex" the data

2. Quality control---identify and remove low quality cells and some transcripts

> "Before analysing the single-cell gene expression data, we must ensure that
all cellular barcode data correspond to viable cells. Cell QC is commonly
performed based on three QC covariates: the number of counts per barcode (count
depth), the number of genes per barcode, and the fraction of counts from
mitochondrial genes per barcode (Ilicic et al, 2016; Griffiths et al, 2018). The
distributions of these QC covariates are examined for outlier peaks that are
filtered out by thresholding (Fig 2). These outlier barcodes can correspond to
dying cells, cells whose membranes are broken, or doublets. For example,
barcodes with a low count depth, few detected genes, and a high fraction of
mitochondrial counts are indicative of cells whose cytoplasmic mRNA has leaked
out through a broken membrane, and thus, only mRNA located in the mitochondria
is still conserved (Fig 2). In contrast, cells with unexpectedly high counts and
a large number of detected genes may represent doublets. Thus, high-count depth
thresholds are commonly used to filter out potential doublets. Three recent
doublet detection tools offer more elegant and potentially better solutions
(DoubletDecon: preprint: DePasquale et al, 2018; Scrublet: Wolock et al, 2019;
Doublet Finder: McGinnis et al, 2018)." [@luecken2019current]

> "In addition to checking the integrity of cells, QC steps must also be
performed at the level of transcripts. Raw count matrices often include over
20,000 genes. This number can be drastically reduced by filtering out genes that
are not expressed in more than a few cells and are thus not informative of the
cellular heterogeneity. A guideline to setting this threshold is to use the
minimum cell cluster size that is of interest and leaving some leeway for
dropout effects. For example, filtering out genes expressed in fewer than 20
cells may make it diffi- cult to detect cell clusters with fewer than 20 cells.
For datasets with high dropout rates, this threshold may also complicate the
detection of larger clusters. The choice of threshold should scale with the
number of cells in the dataset and the intended downstream analysis."
[@luecken2019current]

3. Normalization

> "Each count in a count matrix represents the successful capture, reverse
transcription and sequencing of a molecule of cellular mRNA (Box 1). Count
depths for identical cells can differ due to the variability inherent in each of
these steps. Thus, when gene expres- sion is compared between cells based on
count data, any difference may have arisen solely due to sampling effects.
Normalization addresses this issue by e.g. scaling count data to obtain correct
rela- tive gene expression abundances between cells." [@luecken2019current]

> "In the same way that cellular count data can be normalized to make them
comparable between cells, gene counts can be scaled to improve comparisons
between genes. Gene normalization constitutes scaling gene counts to have zero
mean and unit variance (z scores). ... There is currently no consensus on
whether or not to perform normalization over genes. While the popular Seurat
tutorials (Butler et al, 2018) generally apply gene scaling, the authors of the
Slingshot method opt against scaling over genes in their tutorial (Street et al,
2018). The preference between the two choices revolves around whether all
genes should be weighted equally for downstream analysis, or whether the
magnitude of expression of a gene is an informative proxy for the importance of
the gene. In order to retain as much biological information as possible from the
data, we opt to refrain from scaling over genes in this tutorial."
[@luecken2019current]

4. Transformation

> "After normalization, data matrices are typically log(x+1)-transformed. This
transformation has three important effects. Firstly, distances between
log-transformed expression values represent log fold changes, which are the
canonical way to measure changes in expression. Secondly, log transformation
mitigates (but does not remove) the meanâ€“variance relationship in single-cell
data (Bren- necke et al, 2013). Finally, log transformation reduces the skew-
ness of the data to approximate the assumption of many downstream analysis tools
that the data are normally distributed. While scRNA-seq data are not in fact
log-normally distributed (Vieth et al, 2017), these three effects make the log
transformation a crude, but useful tool. This usefulness is highlighted by down-
stream applications for differential expression testing (Finak et al, 2015;
Ritchie et al, 2015) or batch correction (Johnson et al, 2006; Buttner et al,
2019) that use log transformation for these purposes. It should however be noted
that log transformation of normalized data can introduce spurious differential
expression effects into the data (preprint: Lun, 2018). This effect is
particularly pronounced when normalization size factor distributions differ
strongly between tested groups." [@luecken2019current]
