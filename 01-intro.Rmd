# Introduction

## About the project

The objective of the Immune Mechanisms of Protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (IMPAc-TB) program is to get a thorough understanding of the immune responses necessary to avoid initial infection with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)*, formation of latent infection, and progression to active TB illness. To achieve these goals, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded substantial funding and established multidisciplinary research teams that will analyze immune responses against *Mtb* in animal models (mice, guinea pigs, and non-human primates) and humans, as well as immune responses elicited by promising vaccine candidates. The contract awards establish and give up to seven years of assistance for IMPAc-TB Centers to explain the immune responses required for *Mtb* infection protection. 

The seven centers that are part of the study are (in alphabetical order):

1. Colorado State University
2. Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
3. Seattle Children Hospital
4. [more]

## About this book

The aim of this book is to provide data protocols and data collection templates
for key types of data that are collected over the course of this project. By using
standard templates to record data, as well as starting from defined pipelines to 
process and analyze the data, we aim to standardize the collection and processing
of data across this project.
