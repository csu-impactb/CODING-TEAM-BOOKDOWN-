[["mouse-weights.html", "Chapter 4 Mouse Weights", " Chapter 4 Mouse Weights 4.0.1 Overview Extreme weight loss and loss of muscle mass, also known as cachexia, typically presents along side chronic inflammatory illnesses like Tuberculosis disease @ [baazim2022interplay]. We now recognize that cachexia is part of a systemic response to inflammation, and has been linked to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, and IFNg in humans @ [baazim2022interplay]. Additionally, studies support the role of key immune cell populations such as CD8+ T-cells that, when depleted, counteract muscle and fat deterioration @[baazim2019cd8], and suggest that CD8+ T-cells may metabolically reprogram adipose tissue. In recognition of cachexia related illnesses and diseases, we tracked the progression of weight loss over the course of this study, as is done with many TB-mouse studies @ [smith2022host], @ [segueni2016controlled]. These data is also useful when correlating to CFU count as well as expression of cytokines and other biological markers @ [smith2022host]. Here, mice are weighed in grams weekly to monitor clinical status as TB patients frequently display weight loss as clinical symptom associated with disease progression. The following contains information about how the data was collected, organized, and curated for analysis in RStudio. 4.0.2 Parameters Weights are recorded in an excel worksheet. Column titles are as follows: who_collected date_collected sex dob notch_id mouse_number weight unit cage_number group notes Groups included are: bcg, saline, bcg+id93, saline+id93, saline+noMtb The notes column contains information regarding clinical observations. good reference: https://elifesciences.org/articles/74419#s4 library(readxl) ## Warning: package &#39;readxl&#39; was built under R version 4.1.2 library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ── ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.5 ✓ purrr 0.3.4 ## ✓ tibble 3.1.6 ✓ dplyr 1.0.7 ## ✓ tidyr 1.1.4 ✓ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✓ readr 2.1.2 ✓ forcats 0.5.1 ## Warning: package &#39;readr&#39; was built under R version 4.1.2 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() 4.0.3 Read in data Data is stored in one excel sheet, each week is one sheet named as the date -&gt; return vector for each sheet name 4.0.4 Can also use rio to read in the data, more streamlined 4.0.5 Clean data dataset &lt;- data$before_vaccination %&gt;% select(&quot;sex&quot;, &quot;mouse_number&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;cage_number&quot;, &quot;group&quot;) # combining columns mouse_number and cage_number dataset$mouse_id &lt;- paste(dataset$mouse_number, &quot;-&quot;, dataset$cage_number) 4.0.6 Body weight over time graph and statistics 4.0.7 Weight loss over time graph and statistics 4.0.8 Weight vs CFU 4.0.9 Weight vs ELISA results 4.0.10 Weight vs lesion burden "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
