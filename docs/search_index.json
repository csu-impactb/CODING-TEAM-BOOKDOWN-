The first sheet (named “[x]”) is used to record some metadata for the experiment, while the following sheets are used to record CFUs counts from the plates used for samples from each organ, with one sheet per organ. For example, if you plated data from both the lung and spleen, there would be three sheets in the file: one with the metadata, one with the plate counts for the lung, and one with the plate counts for the spleen. The metadata sheet is used to record information about the overall process of plating the data. Values from this sheet will be used in calculating the bacterial load in the original sample based on the CFU counts. This spreadsheet includes the following columns: organ: Include one row for each organ that was plated in the experiment. You should name the organ all in lowercase (e.g., “lung,” “spleen”). You should use the same name to also name the sheet that records data for that organ for example, if you have rows in the metadata sheet for “lung” and “spleen,” then you should have two other sheets in the file, one sheet named “lung” and one named “spleen,” which you’ll use to store the plate counts for each of those organs. prop_resuspended: In this column, give the proportion of that organ that was plated. For example, if you plated half the lung, then in the “lung” row of this spread sheet, you should put 0.5 in the prop_resuspended column. total_resuspended_uL: This column contains an original volume of tissue homogenate. For example, raw lung tissue is homogenized in 500 uL of PBS in a tube containing metal beads. og_aliquot_uL: 100 uL of th total_resuspended slurry would be considered an original aliquot and is used to peform serial dilutions. dilution_factor: Amount of the original stock solution that is present in the total solution, after dilution(s) plated_uL: Amount of suspension + diluent plated on section of solid agar 5.2 Read in data library(readxl) library(dplyr) library(purrr) library(tidyr) library(stringr) #Replace w/ path to CFU sheet path &lt;- c(&quot;DATA/Copy of baa_cfu_sheet.xlsx&quot;) sheet_names &lt;- excel_sheets(path) sheet_names &lt;- sheet_names[!sheet_names %in% c(&quot;metadata&quot;)] merged_data &lt;- list() for(i in 1:length(sheet_names)){ data &lt;- read_excel(path, sheet = sheet_names[i]) %&gt;% mutate(organ = paste0(sheet_names[i])) data &lt;- data %&gt;% #mutate(missing_col = NA) %&gt;% mutate_if(is.double, as.numeric) %&gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, as.character) %&gt;% pivot_longer(starts_with(&quot;dil_&quot;), names_to = &quot;dilution&quot;, values_to = &quot;CFUs&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(dilution = str_extract(dilution, &quot;[0-9]+&quot;), dilution = as.numeric(dilution)) merged_data[[i]] &lt;- data } all_data &lt;- bind_rows(merged_data, .id = &quot;column_label&quot;) %&gt;% select(-column_label) 5.3 Exploratory analysis and quality checks 5.3.1 Exploratory analysis Dimensions of input data: Based on the input data, data were collected for the following organ or organs: The following number of mice were included for each: The following number of replicates were recorded at each count date for each experimental group: The following number of dilutions and dilution level were recorded for each organ: People who plated and collected the data.
