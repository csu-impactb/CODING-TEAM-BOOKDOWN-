<p>Proteomics allows us to measure which proteins are in each sample, as well
as how much of specific proteins are in each sample. This information is
very important, as proteins play such a critical role in immunological
processes. For example, … [cytokines? receptors? enzymes? others?].
Proteins perform critical processes in the body, including catalzying
reactions (enzymes), providing structure (…), and sending signals across
cells (…). They have such a critical role in health and disease that
most drug targets are proteins [ref].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Protein molecules, rather than DNA or RNA, carry out most cellular functions.
The direct measurement of protein levels and activity within the cell is
therefore the best determinant of overall cell function.”
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lakhani2001microarray">Lakhani and Ashworth 2001</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other assays can also help in determining protein activity. For example,
transcriptomics measure messenger RNA in a sample. Since these messenger
RNA are key to building proteins, based on the expression of genes in the
cell, these transcriptomics can be helpful in understanding which proteins
are being created in certain cells or samples. However, transcriptomics
does not provide a direct measure of protein content, and its results
are not perfectly correlated with protein content. This is because …
Proteomics directly measures the proteins in the sample, and so provides
a more direct picture of these “machines” in the sample.</p>
<p>Proteomics is a bulk, rather than single-cell assay [always true?]. In other
words, it will provide estimates of the protein composition of a sample, but for
the sample as a whole. The final aim of proteomics will often be to compare
the protein composition of different samples. For example, you might
identify which proteins are present in samples from treated animals versus
control animals, or you may compare whether the amount of a certain
protein is higher in diseased versus healthy animals (in fact, this kind
of analysis might be used to identify proteins that can serve as a
biomarker of that disease).</p>
<p>The analysis process for proteomics is quite complex, but it’s helpful
to understand when trying to interpret the data. In the assays that we
use, the proteins are measured using a mass spectrometer, coupled with
a liquid chromatography column <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-steen2004abc">Steen and Mann 2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Before the sample proteins are sent through this equipment, they are broken down
into peptides, which are shorter chains of amino acids. A peptide can be
measured in terms of its number of residues (another name for amino acids, in
the context of their role as monomers in protein sequences), and typically you
aim for peptides with about 20 residues for sending through the equipment
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-steen2004abc">Steen and Mann 2004</a>)</span>. [Why not send the whole protein through?] There are some
proteins that could not be sent through the mass spectrometer, or if they were
would not produce meaningful results, because of characteristics like stability
or solubility of that particular protein and how it interacts with the
equipment’s set-up <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-steen2004abc">Steen and Mann 2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After protein purification, the first step is to convert proteins to a set of
peptides using a sequence-specific protease. Even though mass spectrometers can
measure the mass of intact proteins, there are a number of reasons why peptides,
and not proteins, are analysed in proteomics. Proteins can be difficult to
handle and might not all be soluble under the same conditions… In addition,
the sensitivity of the mass spectrometer for proteins is much lower than for
peptides, and the protein may be processed and modified such that the
combinatorial effect makes determining the masses of the numerous resulting
isoforms impossible. … Most importantly, if the purpose is to identify the
protein, sequence information is needed and the mass spectrometer is most
efficient at obtaining sequence information from peptides that are up to ~20
residues long, rather than whole proteins. Nevertheless, with very specialized
equipment, it is becoming possible to derive partial sequence information from
intact proteins, which can then be used for identification purposes or the
analysis of protein modifications in an approach called ‘top-down’ protein
sequencing.” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-steen2004abc">Steen and Mann 2004</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Digesting the protein into a set of peptides also means that the
physico-chemical properties of the protein, such as solubility and ‘stickiness’,
become irrelevant. As long as the protein generates a sequence of peptides, at
least some of them can be sequenced by the mass spectrometer, even if the
protein itself would have been unstable or insoluble under the conditions used.”
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-steen2004abc">Steen and Mann 2004</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To break the proteins down into peptides, we use proteases, which are enzymes
that break down proteins at certain spots. [How does this work?]</p>
<p>These peptides are then sent through the equipment. The first part of the
process sends them through a liquid chromatography column. The purpose of
this column is to separate the peptides, and in a meaningful way, before
they are sent through the mass spectrometer. By separating them, you
can get some added information to help determine their identity based on
how long it takes them to get through the equipment (retention time).
Often, the column will be designed to separate them by hydrophobicity,
so that a peptide is retained longer or moves through the column more
quickly based on its affinity for water. The information about how
quickly the peptide moved through this column will be recorded as the
“retention time” in the LC/MS read-out data, and will provide a clue to
help in identifying which peptide is represented by a certain part of the
read-out data.</p>
<p>Once the peptide has passed through the liquid chromatography column,
it goes through the mass spectrometer. As it enters, it is ionized
[definition]. The chamber [?] of the mass spectrometer employs
differences in electrical charge to help identify the ion fragments
of the peptide. [More on this] This equipment gives an output in terms
of the intensity [?] recorded at specific mass-to-charge ratios.</p>
<p>This process involves breaking down the original sample into small
components (proteins are broken into peptides, and then those are
broken into ion fragments). The data preprocessing for the resulting
data, therefore, involves a lot of work in putting things back
together—in other words, identifying the ion fragments and then
trying to determine the original peptides and then proteins that
they came from.</p>
<hr>
<p>In proteomics assays that leverage mass spectrometry, the proteins in the
sample are broken down into smaller components (peptides), and it is these
peptides rather than the original proteins that are measured in the
mass spectrometer <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-steen2004abc">Steen and Mann 2004</a>)</span>. The proteins are broken down into
peptides of about 20 residues (amino acids) each using protease, and this
is done because the peptides can be measured more easily and efficiently
than full proteins <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-steen2004abc">Steen and Mann 2004</a>)</span>. However, this also means that the
information will need to be put back together at the end. Once the different
peptides are identified and quantified, it’s necessary to figure out which
protein each originally came from in order to give a picture of the protein
composition of the original sample.</p>
<p>This step links the data output from the equipment with specific proteins, to
use the read-out to characterize the protein make-up of the original sample.
This protein make-up is the scientifically interesting result, as it can help
the scientist answer questions about the biological processes at play under the
conditions which the sample represents. However, translating the equipment
read-out in this way requires several steps that incorporate scientific
principles. For example, one piece of the read-out that can help in linking data
to a protein is the retention time of each measure. The sample is sent through a
liquid chromatography column before it is vaporized in the mass spectrometer.
This LC column is designed to separate components of a sample based on their
physical characteristics, often using hydrophobicity as the characteristics to
separate on. The LC column is designed so that, for example, components that are
extremely hydrophobic will pass through very quickly, while those that are
extremely hydrophillic will be retained on the column longer, and so will have a
longer retention time. Knowing the set-up of the column, as well as knowing the
hydrophillic / hydrophobic characteristics of different peptides, means that the
retention time can be used as a clue in helping to identify which peptide a
given measure from the mass spectrometer represent. To leverage this at the
scale of many peptides in several or many samples, it’s necessary to have tools
that can incorporate this in a way that’s more efficient than using the clue
by hand to try to identify peptides. Often, preprocessing software will
incorporate many of the algorithms like this that are necessary to translate
read-outs from a piece of laboratory equipment into something that is
scientifically meaningful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The peptides that are generated by protein digestion are not introduced to the
mass spectrometer all at once. Instead, they are injected onto a microscale
capillary high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column that is
directly coupled to, or is ‘on-line’ with, the mass spectrometer. The peptides are
eluted from these columns using a solvent gradient of increasing organic content,
so that the peptide species elute in order of their hydrophobicity.” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-steen2004abc">Steen and Mann 2004</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“At the beginning of the 1990s, researchers realized that the
peptide-sequencing problem could be converted to a database-matching problem,
which would be much simpler to solve. The reason database searching is easier
than de novo sequencing is that only an infinitesimal fraction of the possible
peptide amino-acid sequences actually occur in nature. A peptide-fragmentation
spectrum might therefore not contain sufficient information to unambiguously
derive the complete amino-acid sequence, but it might still have sufficient
information to match it uniquely to a peptide sequence in the database on the
basis of the observed and expected fragment ions. There are several different
algorithms that are used to search sequence databases with tandem MS-spectra
data, and they have names such as PeptideSearch, Sequest, Mascot, Sonar ms/ms,
and ProteinProspector.” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-steen2004abc">Steen and Mann 2004</a>)</span></p>

</h3>
<p>Once data are collected, the file can be run through an R workflow. This workflow
will convert the data into a format that is easier to work with for data analysis
and visualization. It will also produce a report on the data in the spreadsheet, and
ultimately it will also write relevant results in a format that can be used
to populate a global database for all experiments in the project.</p>
<p>The next section provides the details of the pipeline. It aims to explain the
code that processes the data and generates visualizations. You do not need to
run this code step-by-step, but instead can access a script with the full
code [here].</p>
<p>To use this reporting template, you need to download it to your computer and
save it in the file directory where you saved the data you collected with the
data collection template. You can then open RStudio and navigate so that you are
working within this directory. You should also make sure that you have installed
a few required packages on R on the computer you are using to run the report.
These packages are: <code>tidyverse</code>, … .</p>
<p>Within RStudio, open the report template file. There is one spot where you will
need to change the code in the template file, so it will read in the data from
the version of the template that you saved, which you may have renamed.
In the YAML of the report template file, change the file path beside “data:”
so that it is the file name of your data file.</p>
<p>Once you’ve made this change, you can use the “Knit” button in RStudio to
create a report from the data file and the report template file.</p>
<p>The report includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Element 1]</li>
<li>[Element 2]</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download an example of a report created using this template by
clicking [here].</p>
<p>When you knit to create the report, it will create a Word file in the
same file directory where you put your data file and report template.
It will also create and output a version of the data that has been
processed (in the case of the weights data, this mainly involves
tracking mice as they change cages, to link all weights that are from
a single animal). This output fill will be named “…” and, like
the report file, will be saved in the same file directory as the
data file and the report template.</p>

<p>This section goes through the code within the report template. It
explains each part of the code in detail. You do not need to understand
these details to use the report template. However, if you have questions
about how the data are being processed, or how the outputs are created,
all those details are available in this section.</p>
